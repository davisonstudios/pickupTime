These are a few projects and WIPs I am working on for the school. Some are just portfolio pieces that I was playing with:

**1. VS Events** is a proof-of-concept for a banquet hall rental business that the owner of Valley School is planning for renting out school facilities on evenings/weekends for events.

**2. PickupTime** is a proof-of-concept for a simpler way than using walkie talkies where kids who's parents are here can be set to "Ready for Pickup" and it could show up in a web page or phone app to let teachers and playground supervisors know when a parent has arrived.It is using rest calls to fetch data from Airtable on the back end as a simple db to store kids and their ready states.

**3. Design Course**Â is a clone of an existing site I liked. I built it as a potential portfolio piece. All the animations and cards etc were written from scratch. It was a self-assigned challenge to make something like the real site.
